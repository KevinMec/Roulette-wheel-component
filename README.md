## ✔️ Recommendations

- **Ideal Group Size:** For best visibility, keep between 4 and 18 participants.
- **Projectors:** Works perfectly for big-screen/projector displays in events or classrooms.
- **Live Streams:** Add extra excitement to online giveaways by sharing your screen.
- **Mobile Use:** Fully responsive, but for the smoothest animation, use it on a desktop browser.
- **Customization:** Try different color palettes or sounds to match your brand or theme.
